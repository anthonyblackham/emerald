Scientists have aggregated over 16 years worth of images of the hubble telescope which they are calling the Hubble Legacy Field. It shows approximately 265000 galaxies. The area of the sky it covers is about what the moon covers or your thumbnail would when held at arms length

This is a link to the news release:

As the image is a whopping 1.2 GB (25500x25500) I took the cropped image and cut it into a bunch of tiny tiles that load interactively on a web map below so you can see the image without crashing your phone or computer.
