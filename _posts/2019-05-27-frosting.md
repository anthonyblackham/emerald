I hate recipes with diatribes. Here is a recipe for the best Angel Food Cake frosting.

### Ingredients:

- 3 egg whites
- 3/4 cup of sugar
- 6 Tablespoons of light corn syrup
- 3 Teaspoons of water
- 1 Teaspoon of Vanilla Extract
- 1 Teaspoon of Almond Extract
- Candy Thermometer

### Directions:

Separate egg whites from egg yolks and beat until white and fluffy.

In a saucepan over medium heat mix sugar, corn syrup, and water until 242 degrees fahrenheit, take off heat and wait for bubbles to subside, turn on mixer with eggwhites and pour constant thin stream into eggwhites until thoroughly mixed. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts.

Done.
