Review:

- Spiciness: 2/5

This ginger beer is quite sugary and is definitely more of a soda than a brew. As it uses real ginger you can taste a bit of spice though it is not overly spicy. It's not a terrible soda, but nothing incredibly special either.

Review:

- Overall: 3/5

This ginger beer has some lemon and lime and as a result tastest a bit like a ginger beer with a sprite base. It's one of the cheaper ginger beers and is a little closer to the line of a brew than a soda, but still tastes sweeter and a bit fruitier than some of the other ginger beers. It's not my top pick but it isn't bad.
