I've been on a quest to try every non-alcoholic ginger beer out there to decide on which is the best. I have used a very scientific process which involved me drinking a variety of ginger beers and then deciding if I liked it or not.

For reference this is a list of the ginger beers in the picture above (and ales or derivatives) from left to right

Review:

- Spiciness: 2/5

This ginger beer is quite sugary and is definitely more of a soda than a brew. As it uses real ginger you can taste a bit of spice though it is not overly spicy. It's not a terrible soda, but nothing incredibly special either.

- Overall: 3/5

This ginger beer has some lemon and lime and as a result tastes a bit like a ginger beer with a sprite base. It's one of the cheaper ginger beers and is a little closer to the line of a brew than a soda, but still tastes sweeter and a bit fruitier than some of the other ginger beers. It's not my top pick but it isn't bad.

This is one of the few ginger ales I've seen that has actual fresh ginger. Bruce cost also makes a variety of ales with different fruits such as pomegranate. Since they use fresh ginger (and quite a bit of it at that) this is one of the more rooty ones if you're into that. It has enough sugar to still be sweet but you'll definitely feel the spice as well, it provides a nice balance.

This ginger beer has a bit of a floor cleaner taste to me. Some people like that but I'm not particularly a fan. It has an ok amount of ginger but I just can't get behind the taste on it.

This ginger beer tastes sweet but has a bit of spice. It has a rooty but sweet subtle root taste as opposed to a bitter root taste. It tastes like a forest to me. It's definitely in my top 5 ginger beers and will buy it if I see it on the shelf

This ginger beer has a good taste with some spice. It's in my top 5 even though it isn't as gingery (the ingredients don't even list ginger, unless it's bucketed under "natural flavor"), it makes up for it in flavor.
