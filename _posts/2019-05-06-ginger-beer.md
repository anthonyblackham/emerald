I've been on a quest to try every non-alcoholic ginger beer out there to decide on which is the best. I have used a very scientific process which involved me drinking a variety of ginger beers and then deciding if I liked it or not.

For reference this is a list of the ginger beers in the picture above (and ales or derivatives) from left to right

- [A. Bedford's ](#a-bedfords)
- [B. Trader Joe's](#b-trader-joes)
- [C. Bruce Cost (Ale)](#c-bruce-cost)

- [U. Kroger](#u-kroger)
- [V. President's Choice](#v-presidents-choice)
- [W. Maine Root](#w-maine-root)

I did a taste panel where I had 5 different people all taste the same ginger beers and rate it on a 1-5 scale based on Heat, Flavour, and Desire. This is the chart with the averaged results. As most weren't typical ginger beer drinkers you can see the chart is skewed to favour the most sugary soda-like drinks as opposed to a typical spicy rooty ginger drink.

My Top 5:

1. Maine Root
2. President's Choice
3. Reading Draft
4. Cock'n Bull
5. Bundaberg

with honourable mentions for Kroger and Rachel's Ginger Beer. You can see my individual reviews of each ginger beer below if you want more detail on nutrition, ingredients, and taste.

Review:

- Spiciness: 2/5
- Overall: 3/5

This ginger beer is quite sugary and is definitely more of a soda than a brew. As it uses real ginger you can taste a bit of spice though it is not overly spicy. It's not a terrible soda, but nothing incredibly special either.

### **B. Trader Joe's:**

Review: 

- Spiciness: 2/5
- Overall: 3/5

This ginger beer has some lemon and lime and as a result tastes a bit like a ginger beer with a sprite base. It's one of the cheaper ginger beers and is a little closer to the line of a brew than a soda, but still tastes sweeter and a bit fruitier than some of the other ginger beers. It's not my top pick but it isn't bad.

### **C. Bruce Cost:**

This is one of the few ginger ales I've seen that has actual fresh ginger. Bruce cost also makes a variety of ales with different fruits such as pomegranate. Since they use fresh ginger (and quite a bit of it at that) this is one of the more rooty ones if you're into that. It has enough sugar to still be sweet but you'll definitely feel the spice as well, it provides a nice balance. 

### **D. Bottoms Up:**

This ginger beer has a bit of a floor cleaner taste to me. Some people like that but I'm not particularly a fan. It has an ok amount of ginger but I just can't get behind the taste on it.

This ginger beer tastes sweet but has a bit of spice. It has a rooty but sweet subtle root taste as opposed to a bitter root taste. It tastes like a forest to me. It's definitely in my top 5 ginger beers and will buy it if I see it on the shelf

### **F. Cock'n Bull:**

This ginger beer has a good taste with some spice. It's in my top 5 even though it isn't as gingery (the ingredients don't even list ginger, unless it's bucketed under "natural flavor"), it makes up for it in flavor.

### **G. Rachel's Ginger Beer:**

This isn't really in the same realm as the other ginger beers as it's really more of a ginger lemonade. It is quite good though as it uses fresh ingredients and has a good amount of ginger that settles at the bottom.

I'm going to be honest. I hate this ginger beer. The pineapple juice is a travesty that ruins the whole thing. It probably wouldn't be bad if it had a different base. It's a real shame because this is one of the ones stocked everywhere, whereas all of my favourite ones are nowhere to be found other than obscure specialty soda shops or halfway across the world.

This ginger beer is labeled as botanically brewed and you can definitely taste a yeasty flowery taste. The capsicum adds to the spice but for the ginger beer its the wrong kind of spice (the kind that burns your tongue rather than your throat) It's an ok brew but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.

It's spicy but a little more on the bitter side. This is really meant as more of a mixer.

It's similar to Fever Tree but a bit different due to the chili extracts. It's still better as a mixer than on it's own in my opinion.

This is technically a ginger ale but it's one of the few that has actual ginger in the ingredients instead of just citric acid. It has a bit of a stale aftertaste but it tastes alright for a soda.

This is just a root beer with a hint of ginger so it can't really be compared to the other ginger beers, but as far as root beers go, it's not bad.

This is an energy drink with a hint of ginger and can't be compared to ginger beers. It also tastes like a circus peanut (the orange ones, not the actual peanuts). People generally drink these for caffeine content rather than taste.

This ginger beer is more of a soda but it is very good. Quite sugary and sweet but you can still feel a some ginger. Bundaberg also has a variety of other sodas that are equally good.

Why don't you just pour mace in my ginger beer and call it good. I like spice probably more than most people but this ginger beer is a travesty. It burns in all the wrong places (namely your tongue and eventually your bum) where any proper ginger beer should have a horseradishy throat burn, not a carolina reaper tongue burn.

Even though this is mass produced at the local grocery store and super cheap, for what it is it provides a nice burn with a decent flavor. Much closer to a soda than a brew with the high fructose corn syrup but the taste and after taste aren't bad at all.

I would go to Canada just for this ginger beer. It has a very nice burn along with a great flavour. It's also probably the cheapest of all the ginger beers as it comes in a 2 litre bottle. I can't recommend this ginger beer enough and wish it were distributed worldwide.

This is hands down the best ginger beer ever made. It has a very strong spice that without fail makes me sneeze every time I drink a bottle. It has an equally decent flavour. They use all pure ingredients which helps. It used to be prolific but now I cannot locate it anywhere. If you can get your hands on it, you won't regret it.
